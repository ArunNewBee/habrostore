<div class="subhd">Values</div>

<p>
Since 1933, Dutch and Habro have lived by its four basic values. We stand by these values, we respect these values and we practice them as much as we preach them. Our values are not just a tradition, but also a fundamental understanding. In our culture at Dutch and Habro, we imbibe the following values:
</p>

<ul class="abl">
<li>Dynamic</li>
<li>Efficient</li>
<li>Vibrant</li>
<li>Convenient</li>
</ul>

<p>
These values have laid the foundation of our culture and practices and the trust that our consumers and stakeholders have in us is all because of these. These values are also extended to our products, our processes, our actions and our operations. Dutch and Habro find it a pleasure to work with individuals who believe in these values and build their lives on them.
